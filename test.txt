This is a test file for KeyVaultManager multi-storage functionality testing.

It contains some sample text that will be encrypted and stored in different storage locations.

The multi-storage implementation allows:
- Storing files in different Azure blob containers
- Retrieving files from specific storage locations
- Listing files by storage location

This file should be uploaded as part of the Postman collection testing.
